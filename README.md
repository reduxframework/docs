# Redux.io Documentation
[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/reduxframework/docs/actions/workflows/vuepress-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/reduxframework/docs/actions/workflows/vuepress-deploy.yml)

Documentation for Redux.io, the world's most powerful and widely used WordPress input framework.

These docs are based off of [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and automatically built by GitHub Actions.

Feel free to send pull requests and improvements. We'd love your help if you found anything we've missed.

## Working with VuePress

```bash
yarn install
```

## Test Locally
```bash
yarn docs:dev
```

## Build HTML
```bash
yarn docs:build
```

Works best with a Unix-based OS.
